# Soya Market Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the market trends, production, and consumption patterns of soybeans across different regions. The insights from this analysis can help stakeholders in the agricultural industry understand the dynamics of the soybean market and make informed decisions.

## Objectives
The main objectives of this analysis are:
- To explore historical data on soybean production and consumption.
- To analyze price fluctuations and their impact on market demand.
- To forecast future trends in the soybean market.
- To identify key factors influencing the soybean market.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains the following:
- **Production Data**: Region-wise production of soybeans over the past few decades.
- **Consumption Data**: Regional and global consumption patterns.
- **Price Data**: Historical price trends for soybeans across different markets.
- **Economic Indicators**: Factors influencing soybean market trends, such as inflation rates, trade policies, and climate conditions.

## Tools and Technologies
The following tools and technologies were used to carry out the analysis:
- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Data Analysis Libraries**: Pandas, Numpy
- **Data Visualization**: Plotly, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn (for trend forecasting)
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Used as the primary platform for analysis.

## Key Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Handling missing data, normalizing values, and preparing the dataset for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating the key trends and patterns in the soybean market.
- **Price Trend Analysis**: Identifying price movements and correlations with economic factors.
- **Market Forecasting**: Using machine learning models to predict future trends in the soybean market.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic plots and charts that allow users to explore different dimensions of the data.

## Results and Findings
- Soybean production has shown a consistent growth trend in the last two decades.
- Price fluctuations were influenced by global trade policies, particularly tariffs imposed by key soybean-exporting countries.
- The demand for soybeans is expected to increase, especially in developing economies due to their growing population and increased demand for plant-based proteins.
- The machine learning models achieved good accuracy in forecasting future production and price trends.

## Installation
To run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arunv8055/Soya-Market-Analysis.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Soya-Market-Analysis
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

## Usage
After running the Jupyter notebook, you can interact with the cells to:
- Explore the soybean production and consumption trends.
- Visualize the price fluctuations using dynamic plots.
- Predict future market trends using the machine learning models.

## Future Enhancements
- Incorporate real-time data to make the forecasting more dynamic.
- Expand the analysis to include other oilseeds and related agricultural products.
- Implement more advanced machine learning models for better accuracy in trend predictions.
